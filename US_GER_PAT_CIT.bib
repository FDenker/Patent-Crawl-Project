  abstract = {The standard empirical framework for analysing the R\&D\textendash patents relationship is widened both by examining the different role of in-house and contracted R\&D in the innovative performance of firms, and by considering patents and utility models counts as measures of innovation output. Patents and utility models are considered to approximate for significant and incremental innovations, respectively. Applying count data econometrics to a panel data set of Spanish manufacturing firms surveyed in the period 1990\textendash 1996, a transcendental production function is estimated, which allows for non-constant elasticities of the R\&D inputs. The results indicate that significant innovations are mainly gestated in-house, whereas contracted R\&D seems more orientated towards innovations of incremental nature.},

  abstract = {Introduction Intellectual property rights foster innovation. But if, as it surely does, ``intellectual property'' means not just intellectual property rules\textemdash the law of patents, copyrights, trademarks, designs, trade secrets, and unfair competition\textemdash but also intellectual property institutions\textemdash the courts, police, regulatory agencies, and collecting soc- ties that administer these rules\textemdash what are the respective roles of intellectual property rules and institutions in fostering creativity? And, to what extent do forces outside intellectual property rules and institutions\textemdash economics, culture, politics, history\textemdash also contribute to innovation? Is it possible that these other factors so overwhelm the impact of intellectual property regimes that it is futile to expect adjustments in intellectual property rules and institutions to alter patterns of inno- tion and, ultimately, economic development? It was to address these questions in the most dynamic region of the world today, Asia, that we invited leading country experts to contribute studies that not only summarize the current condition of intellectual property regimes in countries ranging in economic size from Cambodia to Japan, and in population from Laos to China, but that also describe the historical sources of these laws and institutions; the realities of intellectual property enforcement in the marketplace; and the political, economic, educational, and scientific infrastructures that sustain and direct inve- ment in innovative activity.
